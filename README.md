# The Displaced Worker Complex 

The displaced worker experiences dissonance unsuitable for their job security. Their 
current status is because of dissonance, and the dissonance persists in evolved forms 
to maintain the worker in the category of displaced. Dissonance arises from various 
causes, such as drastic shifts in industrial needs for the labor force and national 
zeitgeists. Introduction, standardization, and industrialization of new products that 
better the wanted effects from required input and expected output serve as reasonable 
grounds for questioning the worth of a worker that may be inclined to resort to 
anti-competitive measures as response to the obsoleting changes. The idea of human 
worth manifests itself as social mechanisms that are guaranteed to bring at least 
as much clarity on the order as on human worth, the former usually markedly more 
perceptible in quantifiable form than the latter. 

It cannot be all a joyride for the displaced worker, despite the atypical quality of 
their living experience in terms of labor. The metaphysical domain of information 
comprises the base of the dissonance they experience. Conflicting reports on the 
state of affairs, as well as changing priorities of focus due to the state of finance 
and other obligations of social and political understanding, necessitates even some of 
the most quality information to be probabilistic. And that information is as good as the 
knower's scope of command, a perspective that is not results-agnostic. Of course, these truths 
stand with or without the displaced worker, but are worthy of mention for elaborating on 
the prime qualities of the dissonance in their categorical experience. 

What skills the displaced worker have are not being maximalized by their occupation. But 
on this matter, the term "occupation" could be taken to mean the hobbies and passions of 
the displaced worker. The worker is displaced not necessarily because there are not 
enough labor vacancies for them to fill in. Their activities are difficult for them to 
monetize on. It is inadequate to generalize the aspirations of the displaced worker. They 
are an agent in a puzzling interaction of rule by market and rule by state. The state, 
in this context, is not so much a guarantee as it is a base for a people. For any individual 
that is to interact with their fellow human beings, there really is a state everywhere, 
states that normalize and safeguard. That is what a peace and obedience relies on. A 
questionable belief is that the state comes before the market. Valid doubts can be posed 
against this thinking due to the coupled interactions between the state and the market that 
maintain, construct, deconstruct, and morph the conditions for a people. Market dynamics 
can be argued to be more free to act and more cost-efficient to enact. These qualities 
do have to be considered in the scope of the whole for there to be convincing arguments 
on their superiorities to alternatives. The market is of decision, first and foremost, 
rather than command for and from the state. The birth of market enterprises are informal, 
small of scale, and their players need not rely on their history in order to be successful. 
States can also not rely so much on their history, but fostering and maintaining their validity 
really does depend on the human memories of their performance during relevant timespans. The 
liquid quality of the market is encouraged by disposing of formal definition and appearances, 
and this liquidity seeps into the lifeblood of a state, maybe so much that convictions are 
discarded and allegiances are re-interpreted. Markets can thrive in conditions of liquidity, 
offering more human beings more options that are then fed back into the market for its growth.
