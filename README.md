# The Displaced Worker Complex 

The displaced worker experiences dissonance unsuitable for their job security. Their 
current status is because of dissonance, and the dissonance persists in evolved forms 
to maintain the worker in the category of displaced. Dissonance arises from various 
causes, such as drastic shifts in industrial needs for the labor force and national 
zeitgeists. Introduction, standardization, and industrialization of new products that 
better the wanted effects from required input and expected output serve as reasonable 
grounds for questioning the worth of a worker that may be inclined to resort to 
anti-competitive measures as response to the obsoleting changes. The idea of human 
worth manifests itself as social mechanisms that are guaranteed to bring at least 
as much clarity on the order as on human worth, the former usually markedly more 
perceptible in quantifiable form than the latter. 

It cannot be all a joyride for the displaced worker, despite the atypical quality of 
their living experience in terms of labor. The metaphysical domain of information 
comprises the base of the dissonance they experience. Conflicting reports on the 
state of affairs, as well as changing priorities of focus due to the state of finance 
and other obligations of social and political understanding, necessitate even some of 
the most quality information to be probabilistic. And that information is as good as the 
knower's scope of command, a perspective that is not results-agnostic. Of course, these truths 
stand with or without the displaced worker, but are worthy of mention for elaborating on 
the prime qualities of the dissonance in their categorical experience. 

What skills the displaced worker have are not being maximalized by their occupation. But 
on this matter, the term "occupation" could be taken to mean the hobbies and passions of 
the displaced worker. The worker is displaced not necessarily because there are not 
enough labor vacancies for them to fill in. Their activities are difficult for them to 
monetize on. It is inadequate to generalize the aspirations of the displaced worker. They 
are an agent in a puzzling interaction of rule by market and rule by state. The state, 
in this context, is not so much a guarantee as it is a base for a people. For any individual 
that is to interact with their fellow human beings, there really is a state everywhere, 
states that normalize and safeguard. That is what a peace and obedience relies on. A 
questionable belief is that the state comes before the market. Valid doubts can be posed 
against this thinking due to the coupled interactions between the state and the market that 
maintain, construct, deconstruct, and morph the conditions for a people. Market dynamics 
can be argued to be more free to act and more cost-efficient to enact. These qualities 
do have to be considered in the scope of the whole for there to be convincing arguments 
on their superiorities to alternatives. The market is of decision, first and foremost, 
rather than command for and from the state. The birth of market enterprises are informal, 
small of scale, and their players need not rely on their history in order to be successful. 
States can also not rely so much on their history, but fostering and maintaining their validity 
really does depend on the human memories of their performance during relevant timespans. The 
liquid quality of the market is encouraged by disposal of formal definition and appearances, 
and this liquidity seeps into the lifeblood of a state, maybe so much that convictions are 
discarded and allegiances are re-interpreted. Markets can thrive in conditions of liquidity, 
offering more human beings more options that are then fed back into the market for their growth. 
A market that wants to do more than simply stay alive reinforces itself through the power 
granted to it by the feedback from the market endpoints and related parties. And that is where 
the line between market and state is blurred. Market dynamics partner with the state, and the 
market maintains a level of autonomy that can do the bidding of the state. Capabilities of 
multi-faceted nature become perfected in execution during the maturization of relevant markets. 
So the displaced worker, being displaced, is willfully so when they do not believe they can 
further the positive magnitude of the multi-faceted nature via concentrating their efforts in 
any one facet. They lose interest. The multi-faceted nature may be reforming in quality and quantity 
and therefore cannot maximally support, relatively speaking, the labor and capital compensation 
expectations of the displaced worker, no matter how hard the worker tries in their attempts to appease 
in the hopes of remaining in or attaining their wanted professional occupation. 

Does the displaced worker really deserve to receive blind sympathies? Who is the displaced worker, a 
competitor in previous settings but now a disenfranchised nobody, unfair to say or unfair because that 
is the truth? So on goes the thinking, because they were a competitor in previous settings, they should 
have very well expected some inconveniences to come their way. But now that they are no longer so, they 
deserve sympathy because that is automatically tied to honorable treatment they are entitled to. Take 
this thinking in action more than a few steps too far, and the focus of attention is no longer on the 
process of market dynamics in flux. It is about the individual's tale, and many others may share the 
individual's experiences; that is where the focus is due, expectations to be received in a passive-like 
way that should be taken for granted instead of the pro-active approach not so inwardly considerate. An 
important concept to consider in clarifying on the displaced worker's conditions is the resource trap. 
Resource traps are geographic: there are valuables, typically inanimate objects, in some region that need 
to be tended to. The conditions of the displaced worker can be attempted justification by telling on their 
needless strife of attempting to do something other than work alongside peers that deals with the regional 
resources. Maybe some will think the displaced worker does not really believe in equality, this a judgment on 
their ideals, since they are clearly not very accepting of the opportunities offered to them that all depend 
on the resources at the region's hand. Of titles and honors, are there any vacancies for the displaced worker 
to fill in? Courtroom courtesan, entertainment sensation, so on?  

The idea of the loyal servant is put to the test in times of strange state games and peculiar market trajectories, 
real and imagined. The loyal servant's decisions in consideration are one thing for what they serve, and their 
aspirations guide them even when those notions are not at the top of the thought stack. Aspirations for self, 
aspirations passed down the family line, aspirations for the favored, et cetera. Loyalty determines what is not 
chosen in the realm of considered decisions. There is debt, loyalty, and identity formatted into ways for a 
tricycle of stability. Complementary, is it? Does one reliably compensate for the other in times where prohibited 
bridges are built precisely because the makers of those bridges are their own deciders, can deliver better results, 
and do it so ideally because of "identical" identity? The servant that is supposed to be loyal asks themself: 
"why be torn between two worlds when there is an escape right there for me to switch sides for the good of all 
that I am?" Two concepts, the Princessean identity and the immigrant stereotype, are related to the displaced worker, 
but not entirely because of objective likeness. The Princessean identity comes from a well-nurturing household. She 
the Princessean listens to wisdom and does not participate in gossip like the rest, for she dedicates her time towards 
bettering herself for her career's sake. But the jobs are not there and the Princessean has to resort to compromising 
her values to pursue her vision, albeit the vision is in real form with begrudging hesitations and perceivable errors 
now.
