# The Displaced Worker Complex 

The displaced worker experiences dissonance unsuitable for their job security. Their 
current status is because of dissonance, and the dissonance persists in evolved forms 
to maintain the worker in the category of displaced. Dissonance arises from various 
causes, such as drastic shifts in industrial needs for the labor force and national 
zeitgeists. Introduction, standardization, and industrialization of new products that 
better the wanted effects from required input and expected output serve as reasonable 
grounds for questioning the worth of a worker that may be inclined to resort to 
anti-competitive measures as response to the obsoleting changes. The idea of human 
worth manifests itself as social mechanisms that are guaranteed to bring at least 
as much clarity on the order as on human worth, the former usually markedly more 
perceptible in quantifiable form than the latter.
